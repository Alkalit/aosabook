Today we've [published the eighteenth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/dagoba-an-in-memory-graph-database.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Dann Toliver](https://twitter.com/dann).

In this chapter, Dann walks us through building a _graph database_ from first
principles in JavaScript. Along the way, we pay careful attention to the design
decisions we are making, and have several opportunities to assess the kinds of
predictions and tradeoffs that practicing programmers face in their work every
day. The end result is a database with surprisingly powerful query capabilities
that runs in your browser.

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
