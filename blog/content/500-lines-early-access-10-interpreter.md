Today we've [published the tenth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Allison Kaptur](https://twitter.com/akaptur).

In this chapter, Allison demystifies the process of writing an interpreter by building one up from very modest beginnings. In the process, we learn about stack machines and how they can be used as a foundation for simply expressing what appear at first glance to be very complicated computations. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
