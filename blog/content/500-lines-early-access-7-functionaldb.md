Today we've [published the seventh chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/an-archaeology-inspired-database.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Yoav Rubin](https://twitter.com/yoavrubin).

Programmers often encounter some sort of persistent data store very early in
our careers. There is nothing quite as opaque and mysterious as a full-featured
database system, regardless of the underlying paradigm used for data
organization.

In this chapter, Yoav shows how using immutability as a guiding principle
allows us to build an astonishingly capable database system in fewer than 500
lines of Clojure. This includes the persistence layer itself, along with a
miniature declarative query languages, and a host of other features. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
