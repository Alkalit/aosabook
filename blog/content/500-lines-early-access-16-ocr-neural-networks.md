Today we've [published the sixteenth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/optical-character-recognition-ocr.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Marina Samuel](http://www.marinasamuel.com/).

Most programmers feel a certain sense of wonder the first few times they write
a working program. However, there is a special sense of wonder that comes from
writing a program that can actually _learn_ behaviours that the programmer has
not explicitly specified.

In this chapter, Marina shows us how to write a program that recognizes
handwritten characters by using the machine-learning technique of training a
_neural network_ to do the job for us. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
