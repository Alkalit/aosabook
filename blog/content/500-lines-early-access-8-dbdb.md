Today we've [published the eighth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/dbdb-dog-bed-database.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Taavi Burns](https://twitter.com/jaaaarel).

Continuing with our persistent datastore theme from [last week](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/10/early-access-release-of-yoav-rubins-archaelogy-inspired-database-chapter/), Taavi's chapter focuses on how we characterize and implement guaranteed behaviour in our systems. This chapter is also different than many of the others, in that we learn about this system the way that most programmers do; by exploring it in its completed form, rather than building it up in increments. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
