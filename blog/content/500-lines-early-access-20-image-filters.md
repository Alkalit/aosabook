Today we've [published the twentieth (!) chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/making-your-own-image-filters.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Cate Huston](https://twitter.com/catehstn).

In this chapter, we build an interactive image filtering program in Java. We also learn about the joy of prototyping, and how to test our code when it relies on frameworks that weren't designed with testability in mind.

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
