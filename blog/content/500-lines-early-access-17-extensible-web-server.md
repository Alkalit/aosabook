Today we've [published the seventeenth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-simple-web-server.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson), the founder of the AOSA series and co-editor of the first two volumes.

In this chapter, we start out by writing the simplest possible web server we
can think of, and then gradually extend it to support richer and more complex
features. In the process, we learn a few lessons about writing software that is
resilient to change. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
