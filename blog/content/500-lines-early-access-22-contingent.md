Today we've [published the _final chapter_](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/contingent-a-fully-dynamic-build-system.html) 
in our [early access release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/) 
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Brandon Rhodes](https://twitter.com/brandon_rhodes) 
and [Daniel Rocco](https://twitter.com/drocco007).

In this chapter, Brandon and Daniel explore the problem of dependency
management in build systems. Throughout their exploration, we learn about how
to use encapsulation, classes, and design patterns in a programming
language with a strong set of builtin data structures and a rich standard
library -- and, perhaps more importantly, when not to.

We'll write up another post next week about the release process and schedule
for both the print and web versions of 500Lines. Thanks for reading along with
us, and a special thank-you to everyone who opened issues and sent feedback on
these chapters. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
