Today we've [published the eleventh chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-pedometer-in-the-real-world.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Dessy Daskalov](https://twitter.com/dess_e).

As computers continue to become more fully integrated into human life, more of us are writing programs that are forced to interact with the messiness of the real, physical world. Dessy demonstrates how we can build and refine effective models of reality (much like many other scientists do every day!) in order to accomplish the practical goal of building a working pedometer. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our

Enjoy!
