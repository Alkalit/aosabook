Today we've [published the sixth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-simple-object-model.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Carl Friedrich Bolz](https://twitter.com/cfbolz).

In this chapter, Carl teaches us that we don't need to know how to write a compiler just to experiment with producing different semantics. He also teaches us a bit about test-driven development along the way. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
