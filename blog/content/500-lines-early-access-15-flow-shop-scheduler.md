Today we've [published the fifteenth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-flow-shop-scheduler.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Dr. Christian Muise](http://haz.ca).

Most programmers eventually encounter the basic idea of the Strategy pattern,
which allows you to switch between multiple implementations of an operation at
runtime depending on the scenario. 

In this chapter, Christian shows us how this pattern can be useful when trying
to solve the _flow shop scheduling_ problem, which is a notoriously difficult
problem in computer science and operations research. More generally, we learn
how to use this pattern in our own practice when faced with intractable
problems.

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
