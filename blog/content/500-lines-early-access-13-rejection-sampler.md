Today we've [published the thirteenth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-rejection-sampler.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Jessica Hamrick](https://twitter.com/jhamrick).

In this chapter, Jess teaches us about _sampling_, a generally applicable technique for complex problems in which it is difficult to find an exact solution. She uses an interesting motivating example -- generating magical items in a game -- to explain how this works. Along the way, we also learn how to write code that works at the limits of floating point precision.

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
