Today we've [published the nineteenth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/the-same-origin-policy.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by Eunsuk Kang, Santiago Perez De Rosso, and Daniel Jackson of the [Software Design Group](http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT.

This chapter is a bit different from the others in the book. Instead of
building a working program, we are building _models_ of systems that allow us
to explore their behaviors. We do this using a modelling language called
[Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/). Along the way, we learn how _agile
modelling_ can help us discover gaps in our designs before or after we've fully
built them out.

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
