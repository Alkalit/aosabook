Today we've [published the fourteenth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/blockcode-a-visual-programming-toolkit.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Dethe Elza](https://twitter.com/dethe).

Visual programming languages are popular in early computer science education because, as Dethe notes in his chapter, "a well-done block language can eliminate syntax errors completely." 

In this week's early-access release, we create our own visual programming language in JavaScript from first principles. Along the way, we think twice about the wisdom of following conventional software organization principles like MVC (model-view-controller) without first analyzing the nature of our problem.

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
