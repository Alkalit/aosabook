Today we've [published the ninth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-3d-modeller.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Erick Dransch](http://www.erickdransch.com/).

Any student of 3D graphics programming will quickly encounter the pattern of the 'scene graph', which is used to organize and orient the components of a scene to be rendered. Erick's chapter teaches us about this pattern, but additionally shows us how this core data structure can be integrated into an interactive system. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
