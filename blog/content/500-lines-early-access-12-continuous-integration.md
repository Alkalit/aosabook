Today we've [published the twelfth chapter](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-continuous-integration-system.html) in our [early access
release](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/)
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by [Malini Das](https://twitter.com/malinidas).

In this chapter, Malini shows us how to design a fault-tolerant, scalable continuous integration system by splitting into multiple components that each have a specialized role. We've seen this a more academic example of this once before in the [cluster chapter](http://aosabook.org/blog/2015/09/early-access-release-of-dustin-j-mitchells-clustering-by-consensus-chapter/); in this one, we get to see a more practical implementation of a distributed system that solves a real-life problem. 

As usual, if you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
[GitHub tracker](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues). 

Enjoy!
